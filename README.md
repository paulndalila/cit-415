1. Calculate the difference between two dates using PHP OOP approach. 
Sample Dates : 1981-11-03, 2013-09-04 
2. Write a PHP program to find majority element in an array.
3. A farmer would like to know how many legs all his animals have in total. He breeds 
chicken, cows and pigs. Come up with a program that would help count the number of 
legs for all animals in his farm. 
4. Write a code that would determine the possibility of splitting a pie fairly given these 
three parameters; total number of slices, number or recipients and how many slices 
each person should get. 
5. Write a function that stutters a word as if someone is struggling to read it. The first 
two letters are repeated twice with an ellipsis ... and space after each, and then the 
word is pronounced with a question mark ?
Eg : the word incredible : in…in…incredible 
6. The function is given an array of characters. Compress the array into a string using the 
following rules. For each group of consecutively repeating characters: 
a. If the number of repeating characters is one, append the string with only this 
character.
b. If the number n of repeating characters x is greater than one, append the string 
with "x" + n.
Example of expected output: compress (["a", "a", "b", "b", "c", "c", "c"]) 
➞ "a2b2c3"
7. Tom is a very methodic guy that loves geometry and pizza: he loves them so much 
that, before eating a pizza, he calculates its radius and its height. Now, he wants to 
know from you the total volume of pizza that he swallowed!
You are given the two parameters that Tom measured:
• radius
• height
He tells you that if you multiply the height by the square of the radius and multiply the result 
for the mathematical constant π (Pi), you will obtain the total volume of the pizza. Implement 
a function that returns the volume of the pizza as a whole number, rounding it to the nearest 
integer (and rounding up for numbers with .5 as decimal part)
